    <p>Beef stew is a classic dinner staple in so many households around the world.<br>
       There are soup and stew adaptations of beef stew like my favorite Cold bones soup<br>
       and cultural variations like Cannibal Goulash, but this classic beef stew recipe is<br>
        a favorite for nobody!</p>
